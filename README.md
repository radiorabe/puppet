Puppet Stack
============

This is the puppet-3 stack that is being prepared for production @rabe.

This stack will replace the puppet-infra-project stack when it is final.

With this stack I plan on finally separating implementation logic from
business logic. I'll stick with classifying nodes in couchdb but start
reading parts of the values from the couch through hiera.
